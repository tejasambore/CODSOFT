# Basic Calculator

This project is a **Basic Calculator** web application developed as part of my internship task. The calculator is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and it provides a simple, interactive interface for performing basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Project Overview

The calculator features a display screen to show user inputs and results, and a set of buttons to perform calculations. This project demonstrates a basic yet effective implementation of core front-end technologies to create a functional, user-friendly application.

## Features

- **Display Screen**: Shows the current input, calculations, and final results.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Interactive Interface**: Buttons for numbers (0-9), operations, and clearing the display.
- **Real-time Calculations**: Updates and performs calculations as the user inputs values.
  
## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and layout of the calculator.
- **CSS3 (Grid Layout)**: Styling and alignment of buttons to create a clean, organized layout.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for handling calculations, user inputs, and button interactions.
